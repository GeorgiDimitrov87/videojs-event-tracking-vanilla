00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.300
<v 1>Lower Cove was amazing.</v>

2
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.040
The water looked like something out of the Caribbean. Katie, what about you?

3
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.873
What did you think?

4
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.030
<v 2>So very, very cute serene.</v>

5
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.310
<v 1>It felt completely unspoiled</v>

6
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.930
It was just amazing cough. Castle was revealed.

7
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.470
And I have to say it was one of the most breathtaking rums I've ever had in my

8
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.280
life.

9
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.620
<v 0>My favorite P cost cost.</v>

10
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.270
So was following color trails and seeing different

11
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.103
spots.

12
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.000
<v 1>I would definitely recommend the UK road trip.</v>

13
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.040
<v 2>And you can just Chuck everything in the car go. And that's what we did.</v>

14
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.300
It allows you to de-stress slow down and unwind.

15
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.830
<v 0>We like to do cool walks on our holidays.</v>

16
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.670
<v 2>The bit that makes it for me is when everybody's settled down, ready for bed,</v>

17
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.680
and you can enjoy a nice cold glass of white wine when the sun is setting

18
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.053
bliss.

19
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.200
<v 0>Oh, that's cute. Doodle.</v>

20
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.840
<v 2>Do is pretty breathtaking.</v>

21
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.730
<v 0>My favorite fact about Lyme Regus was on the boat.</v>

22
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.580
That was so much fun.

23
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.120
<v 1>My favorite thing about being on holiday is being with you.</v>
